Project Overview:
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game written in C++ code using Microsoft Visual Studio. 
This code has used OOP design with a "Game" class that manages the flow and a "Board" class that handles the field of play. 
Furthermore about the game itself, players will take turns entering their moves until either a player wins by having either a X or O placed in a row, column, or diagonally three consecutives times. 
The game will have no winner and result in a tie if all the spaces on the bpard are filled without a consecutive 3 of the same character. 
For installation, a user can clone or download the project files onto their device.
They will need to make sure of C++ compability.
As well opening a terminal in the project folder.
Lastly, compile the program.

Usage Instructions:

On your turn, enter the number of the space where you want to place your piece.
